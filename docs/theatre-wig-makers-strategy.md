# 4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

## Major Theatre Wig Suppliers & Makers (North America)

| Competitor | Location | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Wig Studio 1** | New York, NY | Broadway industry standard, massive network | US-based, long lead times for Canadian clients, premium pricing |
| **Paul Huntley Wigs** | New York, NY | Legendary Broadway wig designer (Hamilton, Wicked) | Boutique operation, exclusive clientele, US-based |
| **Ray Marston Wig Studio** | Toronto, ON | Established Toronto presence, film/TV focus | Primarily serves film; limited theatre focus |
| **Custom Wig Company** | Toronto, ON | Local, custom medical and theatrical wigs | Small operation, limited production capacity |
| **Bob Kelly Wig Creations** | New York, NY | Long-standing Broadway supplier | US-based, aging operation |
| **De Meo Brothers** | New York, NY | Theatrical, film, and specialty wigs | US-based, wholesale focus |
| **Kryolan** | Berlin / Toronto | Global theatrical makeup and wig supplies | Product supplier, not custom maker; limited wig construction |
| **Banbury Postiche** | London, UK | Premier UK theatrical wig maker (National Theatre, RSC) | UK-based, expensive transatlantic shipping |

## Canadian-Specific Competitors

| Competitor | Location | Focus | Market Share |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Haircraft Studios** | Toronto, ON | Film, TV, and commercial wigs | ~15% of Ontario theatrical market |
| **Continental Hair** | Toronto, ON | Medical wigs with some theatrical | Primarily medical; theatrical is secondary |

## Market Gaps

2. **Limited domestic custom lace-front construction capacity** — Stratford and Shaw make their own, but smaller companies struggle to source locally
3. **No integrated hair supply + wig construction pipeline** — CrownCommerce's existing hair sourcing infrastructure is a significant advantage
4. **Educational gap** — no formal Canadian training program specifically for theatrical wig making (closest is Sheridan College's makeup program)
5. **Film/TV crossover underserved** — growing Ontario production industry needs more local wig resources

# 6. SOURCING & MANUFACTURING

# 7. PRICING STRATEGY

## Principles

1. **Below New York pricing** — Position 15–25% below US competitors for comparable quality to capture Canadian productions currently importing
2. **Above amateur-grade** — Maintain premium positioning to signal professional quality
3. **Volume incentives** — Discounted rates for multi-production season contracts
4. **Canadian dollar advantage** — The weaker CAD makes Canadian-made wigs attractive for US touring productions playing Canadian venues

| New York wig houses | $3,500–$7,000 |
| London wig houses | $4,000–$8,000 |
| **CrownCommerce (target)** | **$1,800–$4,500** |
| Local independent makers | $1,200–$3,000 (variable quality) |

## Season Contract Pricing (Example)

| Package | Includes | Price (CAD) |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Small Season** (4–6 productions) | 10 custom wigs + maintenance for run | $15,000–$25,000 |
| **Medium Season** (8–10 productions) | 25 custom wigs + maintenance + 10 rentals | $35,000–$60,000 |

# 10. WORKFORCE & TRAINING PIPELINE

## The Talent Challenge

Theatrical wig making is a specialized craft with a shrinking talent pool:

- Average age of experienced theatrical wig makers in North America is **50+**
- Formal training programs are scarce — most wig makers learn through multi-year apprenticeships
- Key skills: hand ventilation, lace work, period styling, color matching, fitting
- A skilled wig maker can take **40–80 hours** to construct a single custom wig

## Hiring Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Team (Year 1–2)

| Role | Skills Required | Salary Range (CAD) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Lead Wig Maker** | 10+ years theatrical wig construction, ventilation mastery | $55,000–$75,000 |

# 11. REGULATORY & UNION CONSIDERATIONS

## IATSE (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees)

### Relevant Locals

| Local | Jurisdiction | Coverage |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **IATSE Local 873** | Toronto | Film/TV hair, makeup, and wig departments |
| **IATSE Local 828** | Ontario | Stage technicians (some theatrical wig roles) |
| **IATSE Local 798** | New York (touring) | Makeup and wig artisans for touring Broadway productions playing Canadian venues |

### Implications for CrownCommerce

- **Supplying product:** No union restrictions on selling hair or wigs to productions
- **On-set/backstage services:** If providing wig dressing or maintenance services during production runs, workers must be IATSE members or the production must approve non-union vendors
- **Film/TV:** Ontario film productions under IATSE agreements require union wig/hair department heads — CrownCommerce staff providing on-set services would need IATSE membership
- **Strategy:** Start as a **supplier** (no union requirement), then pursue IATSE signatory status if expanding into on-set services

## ADC (Associated Designers of Canada)

- Wig and makeup designers for major Canadian theatres are typically ADC members
- Building relationships within ADC is essential for being specified as a preferred supplier
- Attend ADC events and support their professional development initiatives

## Health & Safety

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **WHMIS compliance** | Required for workshop handling of dyes, adhesives, and chemicals |
| **Fire safety** | Workshop must meet Ontario Fire Code for flammable materials (hair, solvents) |
| **Ventilation** | Adequate extraction for dye and chemical fumes per Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act |
| **Insurance** | Product liability for wigs used in performance (allergic reactions, fit failures) |

## Import Regulations (Leveraging Existing Knowledge)

CrownCommerce's existing expertise in hair import compliance (HS codes 6703.00.00 and 6704.20.00, CBSA documentation, LDCT duty-free programs) applies directly to theatrical hair sourcing.

- Year 2 requires capital investment in the workshop; margins improve with in-house construction
- Year 3 assumes 3–5 major institutional clients and growing film/TV contracts

# 13. RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Talent scarcity** | Cannot fulfill orders without skilled wig makers | High | Apprenticeship program, competitive wages, poach from adjacent industries (cosmetology) |
| **Seasonal demand** | Theatre seasons run Sep–Jun; summer can be slow | High | Target film/TV (year-round) and Stratford/Shaw (summer seasons) to balance |
| **Client concentration** | Over-reliance on 1–2 major clients | Medium | Diversify across theatre, film/TV, opera, educational sectors |
| **Quality inconsistency** | Outsourced construction in Year 1 may vary | Medium | Strict QC protocols, sample approval process, build in-house capacity quickly |
| **Exchange rate fluctuation** | Hair sourced internationally; revenue in CAD | Medium | Forward contracts on large orders, maintain 3-month inventory buffer |
| **Union complications** | IATSE requirements for on-set services | Low | Start as product supplier; obtain IATSE signatory status before offering backstage services |
| **Competition from New York** | US wig houses enter Canadian market more aggressively | Low | Local presence, faster turnaround, lower price point, Canadian dollar advantage |
| **Economic downturn** | Arts funding cuts reduce production budgets | Medium | Film/TV is more recession-resistant than live theatre; diversify revenue streams |

# KEY STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Leverage CrownCommerce's existing hair supply chain** — The sourcing infrastructure, import expertise, and supplier relationships built for the consumer hair business directly reduce startup costs and timelines for theatrical hair supply
2. **Start as a supplier, grow into a maker** — Selling hair to existing wig departments requires no specialized artisan workforce; use this revenue to fund the wig construction workshop
3. **Target the talent gap** — The apprenticeship program is both a competitive advantage (loyal workforce) and a marketing tool (industry goodwill)
4. **Prioritize Stratford and Shaw festivals** — Landing even one major repertory theatre validates the brand and opens doors across the industry
5. **Balance theatre and film/TV** — Theatre provides seasonal stability and prestige; film/TV provides year-round revenue and growth
6. **Position below New York pricing** — Canadian productions currently importing US wigs are price-sensitive; a quality local option at 15–25% less is compelling
7. **Build the portfolio obsessively** — In theatrical wig making, reputation is everything; every production credit builds the brand
8. **Invest in the Hart House partnership** — University relationships create a pipeline of future production managers and designers who will specify CrownCommerce as their wig supplier for decades
