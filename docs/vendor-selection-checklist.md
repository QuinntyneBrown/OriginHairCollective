# Vendor Selection Checklist & Scorecard

## Bulk Hair Exporter Evaluation — Origin Hair Collective

**Purpose:** Use this checklist to evaluate and compare suppliers of bulk hair for wigs and extensions across sourcing platforms (Alibaba, Made-in-China, 1688.com, DHgate, trade shows, direct factory contacts). Score each vendor, then compare totals to identify the best value suppliers.

**How to use:**
1. Create one copy of this scorecard per vendor
2. Score each criterion on the scale provided (0 = unacceptable, up to the max shown)
3. Tally category subtotals and the grand total
4. Compare vendors side-by-side based on their grand totals and individual section scores

**Scoring priority:** Value (quality relative to price) is weighted most heavily.
