# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Program Name:** Crown Rewards

**Tagline:** *"Every purchase crowns you."*

Crown Rewards is a points-based loyalty program designed to increase customer retention, raise average order value, and build brand community for Origin Hair Collective. The program rewards customers for purchases, referrals, engagement, and brand advocacy with redeemable points and tier-based benefits.

The hair extensions market is driven by repeat purchases — premium virgin and Remy hair lasts 1–5 years, but customers regularly buy new textures, lengths, and styles. A loyalty program converts one-time buyers into long-term brand advocates in a market where trust and product quality drive purchasing decisions.

**Key Design Principles:**

- **Simple to understand** — 1 dollar spent = 1 Crown Point earned at base tier
- **Aspirational tiers** — motivate higher spending with visible, desirable benefits
- **Community-first** — reward social sharing and referrals to match the social-media-driven market
- **Premium positioning** — tier names and benefits reinforce the brand's premium identity

# 2. PROGRAM GOALS

| Goal | Target | Timeframe |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Increase repeat purchase rate | 25% → 45% | 12 months |
| Raise average order value | +15% across loyalty members | 12 months |
| Grow active loyalty membership | 60% of registered customers enrolled | 6 months |
| Reduce customer acquisition cost | -20% via referral program | 12 months |
| Increase customer lifetime value | +30% for loyalty members vs. non-members | 18 months |

---

# 3. TIER STRUCTURE

Crown Rewards uses a four-tier system based on cumulative annual spend (CAD). Tiers reset annually on the member's enrollment anniversary date.

| Tier | Name | Annual Spend Threshold | Points Multiplier | Badge |
|------|------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Starter** | $0 | 1x (1 pt / $1) | Bronze crown |
| 2 | **Luxe** | $250 | 1.5x (1.5 pts / $1) | Silver crown |
| 3 | **Elite** | $600 | 2x (2 pts / $1) | Gold crown |
| 4 | **Icon** | $1,200 | 3x (3 pts / $1) | Platinum crown |

### Tier Qualification Rules

- Spend is calculated on completed, non-refunded orders only.
- Tier status is evaluated in real time — as soon as the spend threshold is crossed, the customer is upgraded immediately.
- At annual reset, if a customer's spend in the previous 12 months no longer qualifies for their current tier, they are downgraded one tier (not dropped to Starter). This provides a grace cushion.
- Points already earned are never lost due to tier changes. Only the earning multiplier changes.

### Tier Distribution Forecast (Year 1)

| Tier | Expected % of Members | Rationale |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| Starter | 55% | Most new customers start here |
| Luxe | 25% | 2–3 bundle purchases per year |
| Elite | 15% | Regular buyers, multiple textures/lengths |
| Icon | 5% | Power customers, stylists, influencers |

---

# 4. POINTS EARNING RULES

## 4.1 Purchase Points

The primary earning mechanism. Points are awarded after an order is marked as delivered and the return window has closed.

| Activity | Points Earned | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Spend $1 CAD (Starter) | 1 point | Base rate |
| Spend $1 CAD (Luxe) | 1.5 points | 1.5x multiplier |
| Spend $1 CAD (Elite) | 2 points | 2x multiplier |
| Spend $1 CAD (Icon) | 3 points | 3x multiplier |

- Points are calculated on the order subtotal before taxes and shipping.
- Points earned from a purchase cannot be used to pay for that same purchase.
- If a product is returned or refunded, the corresponding points are deducted.

## 4.2 Engagement Points

Bonus points for non-purchase activities that build community and brand awareness.

| Activity | Points Earned | Frequency Limit |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Create an account | 50 points | One-time |
| Complete profile (name, phone, birthday) | 25 points | One-time |
| Leave a product review | 15 points | Per review, max 5/month |
| Share a purchase on social media | 10 points | Per share, max 3/month |
| Subscribe to newsletter | 10 points | One-time |
| Refer a friend (referrer bonus) | 100 points | Per successful referral |
| Birthday bonus | 50 points | Annual |
| Enrollment anniversary | 25 points | Annual |

## 4.3 Bonus Point Events

Time-limited promotional events to drive specific business goals.

| Event Type | Example | Typical Multiplier |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Double Points Day | "2x points on all orders this weekend" | 2x base rate |
| Category Bonus | "3x points on Body Wave textures" | 3x on qualifying items |
| New Product Launch | "50 bonus points with any new arrival purchase" | Flat bonus |
| Holiday Promotion | "Triple points during Black Friday week" | 3x base rate |

Bonus point events are configured by admins and applied automatically at checkout and during points calculation.

---

# 5. POINTS REDEMPTION

## 5.1 Redemption Rate

**100 points = $1.00 CAD discount**

This rate is simple to communicate and sets a clear value per point. At the base tier (1 pt/$1), a customer earns a 1% return on spend — competitive with similar retail programs and sustainable for margins.

## 5.2 Redemption Options

| Reward | Points Required | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Dollar discount** | 100+ points (in increments of 100) | Applied at checkout, reduces order total |
| **Free shipping** | 300 points | Waives standard shipping on one order |
| **$5 off** | 500 points | Preset discount coupon |
| **$15 off** | 1,500 points | Preset discount coupon |
| **$30 off** | 3,000 points | Preset discount coupon |
| **Free sample bundle** | 2,000 points | Curated sample pack (textures to try) |
| **Exclusive early access** | 0 points (tier-gated) | Elite and Icon members get early access to launches |

## 5.3 Redemption Rules

- Minimum redemption: 100 points ($1.00 discount).
- Points can be combined with sale prices but not with other coupon codes (to prevent stacking abuse).
- Points redemption cannot exceed 50% of the order subtotal (ensures revenue protection).
- Redeemed points are deducted immediately upon order placement. If the order is cancelled, points are refunded within 24 hours.

# 6. TIER BENEFITS

Benefits increase with each tier to create a clear incentive for customers to spend more.

| Benefit | Starter | Luxe | Elite | Icon |
|---------|---------|------|-------|------|
| Points multiplier | 1x | 1.5x | 2x | 3x |
| Free standard shipping | — | On orders $100+ | On orders $75+ | All orders |
| Birthday bonus points | 50 pts | 75 pts | 100 pts | 200 pts |
| Exclusive sales access | — | — | 24-hour early access | 48-hour early access |
| New product early access | — | — | Yes | Yes |
| Free gift with order | — | — | Quarterly | Monthly |
| Dedicated support priority | — | — | — | Yes |
| Annual loyalty gift | — | — | — | Curated bundle |
| Points expiry extension | 12 months | 15 months | 18 months | 24 months |
| Referral bonus (referrer) | 100 pts | 125 pts | 150 pts | 200 pts |

---

# 7. REFERRAL PROGRAM

Referrals are a key acquisition channel for hair extension brands, since recommendations carry high trust in this market.

## How It Works

1. A loyalty member generates a unique referral link or code from their account dashboard.
2. The referred friend uses the link/code on their first purchase and receives a **$10 discount**.
3. After the referred friend's order is delivered, the referrer earns **100–200 points** (tier-dependent).
4. There is no limit on how many friends a member can refer.

## Anti-Fraud Rules

- The referred friend must be a new customer (new email, not previously registered).
- The referred friend's order must meet a minimum subtotal of $50.
- Self-referrals (same payment method, shipping address, or IP as the referrer) are flagged for manual review.
- Points are only credited after the referred friend's return window closes.

## Referral Tracking

Each referral code is tied to the member's loyalty account. The system tracks:

- Referral code usage count
- Conversion rate (clicks → sign-ups → purchases)
- Total points earned from referrals
- Flagged/suspicious referrals

---

# 8. BIRTHDAY & ANNIVERSARY REWARDS

## Birthday Rewards

- Members who have a birthday on file receive bonus points automatically on their birthday.
- Points amount depends on tier (50 for Starter, up to 200 for Icon).
- A personalized email is sent with a birthday greeting and points notification.
- Birthday can only be set once (no changing to farm points).

## Enrollment Anniversary

- On the anniversary of joining Crown Rewards, members receive 25 bonus points.
- A "happy anniversary" email is sent with a summary of points earned and tier progress that year.

---

# 9. POINTS EXPIRATION & POLICIES

## Expiration

- Points expire based on the member's tier at time of earning (see Tier Benefits table).
- Base expiry is 12 months from the date of earning for Starter members.
- Expiration is extended for higher tiers (up to 24 months for Icon).
- Any purchase activity resets the expiry clock for all existing points.
- Members receive email reminders at 90 days, 30 days, and 7 days before points expire.

## Refund & Cancellation Impact

| Scenario | Points Impact |
|----------|--------------|
| Order cancelled before shipping | Pending points are voided |
| Full refund after delivery | Earned points are deducted from balance |
| Partial refund | Points deducted proportionally to refund amount |
| Exchange (same value) | No change |
| Points used on a refunded order | Points are restored to balance |

## Account Policies

- Loyalty accounts are tied to the customer's registered email address.
- Points are non-transferable between accounts.
- Points have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash.
- Origin Hair Collective reserves the right to adjust the program terms with 30 days notice.
- Fraudulent activity (fake accounts, self-referrals, abuse of bonus events) results in account suspension and points forfeiture.

# 11. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS

## Cost Model

Points represent a deferred discount liability. At 100 points = $1, each point has a value of $0.01 CAD.

| Metric | Calculation | Estimate (Year 1) |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Average order value (AOV) | Current baseline | $180 CAD |
| Points earned per order (Starter) | $180 × 1 pt/$1 | 180 points ($1.80 liability) |
| Points earned per order (Luxe) | $180 × 1.5 | 270 points ($2.70 liability) |
| Points earned per order (Elite) | $180 × 2 | 360 points ($3.60 liability) |
| Points earned per order (Icon) | $180 × 3 | 540 points ($5.40 liability) |
| Weighted avg liability per order | Blend by tier distribution | ~$2.50/order (~1.4% of AOV) |
| Expected redemption rate | Industry benchmark | 60–70% of points earned |
| Effective cost per order | $2.50 × 65% redemption | ~$1.63/order (~0.9% of AOV) |

## Breakage Benefit

Industry data shows 30–40% of loyalty points are never redeemed ("breakage"). This reduces the actual program cost. With a 12-month expiration policy:

- Points that expire reduce the outstanding liability on the books.
- Conservative estimate: 35% breakage rate, reducing effective program cost to ~0.9% of revenue.

## ROI Justification

| Benefit | Conservative Estimate |
|---------|---------------------|
| Repeat purchase rate increase | 25% → 40% (+60% improvement) |
| AOV increase for loyalty members | +12% ($180 → $202) |
| Customer lifetime value increase | +25% |
| Referral-driven new customers | 15% of new acquisitions |
| Program cost as % of revenue | ~0.9% |

At an effective cost under 1% of revenue, the program pays for itself if it generates even a modest increase in repeat purchases or average order value.
